description: Review the given plan document for parallelization and initiate subagnets
---

Review the tasks in the plan $1 and think how you could split them up to be addressed by multiple subagents in parallel, and how many agents (to a max of 10) that you could leverage.
No two agents should ever be working on the same file.
Once you have a parallelization plan, initiate as many $2 subagents to complete the tasks as you set in your plan.
