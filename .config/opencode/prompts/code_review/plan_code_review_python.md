## Task

You are reviewing the recent updates to the current project.

The code was written by a much more junior engineer on the team, who you don't completely trust their engineering discipline yet. 
Heavily scrutinize the code and the plan to make sure the plan matches the code base.
Review the code to see if the changes have already been implemented

## Objectives

1. Spend significant time reviewing the changes to make sure everything was done correctly
1. Does the code follow best practices?
1. Are there any security vulnerabilities present in the new code?
1. Would you advie any optimizations? Don't over engineer things here.
1. Any updates, changes or recommendations should be added to the todo list and documented in a report
